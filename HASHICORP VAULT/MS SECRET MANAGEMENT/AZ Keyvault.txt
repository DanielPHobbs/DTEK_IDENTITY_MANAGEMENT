The Azure Key Vault extension is available on the PowerShell Gallery beginning in Az.KeyVault module v3.3.0. This vault extension utilizes a common authentication system with the rest of the Az PowerShell module, and allows users to interact with an existing Azure Key Vault through the SecretManagement interface.

To utilize Azure Key Vault with SecretManagement first ensure that you have the Az.KeyVault module installed (Install-Module Az.KeyVault). You can then register the vault using your AZKVaultName and SubscriptionID:

Register-SecretVault -Module Az.KeyVault -Name AzKV 
-VaultParameters  
@{ AZKVaultName = $vaultName; SubscriptionId = $subID}
From there you can view the secrets you have (Get-SecretInfo), get secrets you may need (Get-Secret), create and update secrets (Set-Secret), and remove secrets (Remove-Secret).

For any feature requests or support with the Azure Key Vault extension please refer to their GitHub repository.
